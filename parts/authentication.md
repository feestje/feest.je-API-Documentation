Authentication
--------------

This page will tell you somthing about the authentication that is used in
the feest.je API. If you would need some authentication to execute a call,
you basically need to be logged in with a Feest.je accout.

Authentication False
--------------------
If the documentation of a call says that 'authentication required' is false,
it means that there is no authentication needed to execute the call. You 
can do this call anytime without being logged in to feest.je.

Authentication True
-------------------
If the documentation of a call say that 'authentication required' is true, 
it means that you need to be logged in to feest.je before you can execute
the call. Usually these are calls that involve the logged in user(signing up
for something, creating relations, etc). 



This is all there is about the authentication. If you have more specific 
question about the authentication and couldn't find the answer here, you can
always send an email to ....@feest.je
